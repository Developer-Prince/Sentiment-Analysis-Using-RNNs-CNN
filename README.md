# Sentiment Analysis



we have extracted tweets from customers about various tech firms who manufacture and sell mobiles, computers , laptops, etc the task is to identify if the tweets have a negative sentiment towards such companies or products

## About Dataset
we have train and text dataset. Train data set has both input and output variable.
we need to classify the tweeta in test dataset.

Number of observations in Train Set : 7,920

Number of observations in Test Set : 1,953

## Data Download

You can download the dataset from [DataHack Problem](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-identify-the-sentiments/)

## My Approch to the problem


1.   Pre-Process the data
2.   Define the architecture of you model
3.   Since it is a binary classification problem. make sure that you use the 'sigmoid' activation funxtion in the output layer
4.   Train the model
5.   Do the same preprocessing on the test dataset.
6.   generate prediction for the test set using trained model
7.   save the predictions in the csv file.


# Dataset contain 
0 refers - Positive

1 refers - Negative
